=== Configuration

You should have something like this in config/recurly.yml.

  ---
  username: api-test@yourcompany.com
  environment: :sandbox
  subdomain: your-recurly-subdomain
  password: 12345678901234567890123456789012
  private_key: 12345678901234567890123456789012

Alternatively, you may use a file in /config/initializers/recurly.rb with contents:

  Recurly.configure do |c|
    c.username = 'api-test@yourcompany.com'
    c.password = 'your_api_key'
    c.private_key = 'your_private_key'
    c.environment = :production # or :sandbox for test sites
    c.subdomain = 'your-recurly-subdomain'
  end

The environment variable can be ":sandbox" or ":production". This environment
corresponds with Recurly's sandbox/test sites or production/live sites. Please
note that only Recurly API users should be used with the Recurly ruby client.
Using a user's credentials is not supported.

Please log into Recurly and click "API Credentials" to find your API credentials.
